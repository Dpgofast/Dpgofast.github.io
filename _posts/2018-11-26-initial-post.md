My current endeavor is to sort, catagorize and predict the most likely choice of vehicle purchase for each state in the United States. While it is no small task to retrieve this data, I believe the insights gained from it can improve the marketing strategies for vehicle manufacturers especially in those states where a competitor holds the market. 

### h3 Helping The Consumer
With the data collected and organized by region and popular vehicle, a consumer focused model will help those looking to purchase a new vehicle decide by popular opinion what vehicles are best suited to their particular region. For example it may prove more cost effective to purchase a prius in New York than it would in say Alaska.
