### Project Focus
To find a better understanding of how the relationship between car and driver will evolve in the years to come. Machine learning has the ability to bring about self driving cars as well as more intuitive cars that can gain an intuition for an idividuals driving habits.

## A Small Biography 
### Industry Of Interest
  If I were to choose one industry to focus on in my Data Science career it would be automotive. From a very young age I took interest in all things engine powered. Cars, trucks and motorcycles captured my imagination and the thought of going fast consumed my early years. Through my teens I fixed many vehicles eventually working into a role as a lead mechanic at a local shop, this job gave me the opportunity and the knowledge to build a few racecars of my own to quench my need to go fast. Soon I took an interest in making cars both go fast and be reliable so my hunt for knowledge began. After attending a few semesters of school for automotive technology I found that the underlying mechanics of how to fix a car is rather boring to me as well as not the direction my thirst for knowledge wanted me to go, I set off in search of another avenue. Electronics engineering at the time was the only logical path I could find. The automotive industry was firm on their path to use faster and more complex electonic components to acheieve more efficient and reliable vehicles so my interest was piqued once again. Now with the emerging field of Data Science and the ability to leverage computing power to make predictions and find patterns I believe my ultimate goal can be achieved. Not only collect the information needed but to use it to predict future trends and possible outcomes gives me the tools and ability to predict things in vehicles like component failures, performance issues, fuel efficiency shortfalls, and possible future modification outcomes all using data thats readily available.
### Particular Focus
  To choose a single focus in the Data Science world is a daunting task. I find myself drawn in many directions within the automotive industry when using the tools and techniques of data science. The ability to create models to help sales and marketing as well as research and development teams has an appeal for the fact I could see results of my work in a relatively short period of time. My interests currently draw me more into the realm of self driving or intelligent automotive systems. Creating a car that can think or learn to adapt to an individuals habbits and possibly drive autonomously has the most appeal currently.
